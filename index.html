            Before I came to America I lived in Trinidad for a while,where it had a course called Information Technology. With this course I learnt mainly about hardware and software of a computer but the software was not as advance as HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) or CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). However I did learn to program using Pascal but was unable to properly understand it. This was due to the class beig unfrequent and me not keeping up with what was going on.Therefore before university my  knowledge of HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) was little to none.

            At the beginning of enter University of Massachusetts Boston I did not even know  what HTML was neither the less CSS but after I bagan my course of CS187 I was enlightened. At first I was nervous about embarking on this journey but I went along with it anyways. My professor made the expierience easy as well as enjoyable. From not being able to even begin a website I am now able to make one by myself but not an entirely complex one. My profieciency with HTML and CSS increased as the weeks went on. The following are ways in which I have developed as a user of HTML and CSS.

        <p style=font-family: "New Times Roman",Times,serif;>
            
        After learning about these two skills I have realized how important they are. In todays society people use websites for many different things some use it for blogging while others for business.By being able to create a website I feel like I am able to better move forward with my future plans. These skills are vital for anyone trying to rise through the ranks in the technological world. I am very grateful that I was able to learn these skills at such a young age.I think that if I was ble to learn these skills to this degree in a short period of time then anyone can do it if they have an amazing professor as I did.
